\section{Introduction}
The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment will carry out
systematic research on the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions,
in particular, at highest net baryon densities. These conditions will
be met by colliding beams of heavy ions on targets in the energy range from
2 to 14, eventually 45 GeV/nucleon, as they will be provided with highest
intensities by the heavy-ion synchrotron SIS-100, and in a future stage
by the SIS-300 machine of the Facility for Anti-proton and Ion Research
(FAIR) at GSI, Darmstadt, Germany.

The Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the central detector fo the CBM
experiment at FAIR. Its task is the standalone trajectory reconstruction
of the high multiplicities of charged particles originating from high-rate
beam-target interactions. The silicon microstrip detectors must be
radiation hard and are read out by a fast self triggering front-end
electronics.

\subsection{Quality Test Center}
% Motivation program of QA. Task and condition in QTC
% TODO : Simplify and move some details to QA section
Due to a large-scale sensor production, the effective QA of sensors can be
achieved by a collective effort among the Quality Test Centers. Fig. \ref{ywu:fig:qa}
indicates the variety of quality assurance tests and the corresponding QTC
in charge. The overall QA program can be represented as a combination of
tests performed on sensor and strip level.

\section{Quality Assurance in GSI}
Quality assurance for silicon sensor includes visual tests on arrival, control and
distribution to testing centers, verification of specifications via tests and central
database for keeping track of sensor response.

\paragraph{Optical inspection} is intended to identify any kinds of surface
defects. This test will be performed on 100\% of the sensors at the EKU
test center. Sensors with identified defects will undergo further electrical
tests.

\paragraph{Bulk electrical tests} are performed to determine the overall
sensor behavior at the operational conditions. Current-voltage (I-V) and
capacitance-voltage (C-V) tests are conducted after optical inspection. The
I-V tests determines the leakage current of a sensor while the C-V tests
determines the full depletion voltage of a sensor.

\paragraph{Long-term stability tests} will be performed on a fraction of the
sensors. The leakage current of the sensors will be monitored for a time period
of 48-72 hours in order to evaluate their stability.

\paragraph{Microscopic electrical tests} focus on determination of various sensor
parameters and their correspondence with specifications, mainly coupling
capacitance $C_{c}$, interstrip capacitance $C_{is}$, interstrip resistance
$R_{is}$, and bias resistance $R_{bias}$.

\paragraph{Strip diagnostic tests} aim to identify strip defects originating
from the complex fabrication process that cannot be identified by the optical
inspection. These defects comprise mainly ohmic contacts or short circuits
between the strip implant and the readout strip (so-called ``pinholes''), short
circuits between two or more readout strips, and strips exhibiting high leakage
current.

\end{figure}

\section{QA Database}
The CBM STS quality assurance (QA) database will gather into one repository
all relevant measurements obtained during the STS sensors tests performed by
the STS QA responsible laboratories. Any new or updated results will be stored
in a dedicated database and can then be directly accessed form any location either
a web interface or ROOT macro.

\subsection{Design}
All new STS QA measurements as well as their history should be recorded. For this
purpose the STS QA database is implemented using FairDB SQL Interface based on
ROOT Library.\\
A main sensor table is mapped to a ROOT based QA parameter manager which holds
different lists of sensor features indexed via the sensor unique id (see 
Fig. \ref{ywu:fig:stsdb}). The feature include sensor geometry, ownership, channel
map and QA results \cite{ywu:ob}. For strip diagnostic tests, the information on 
identified defect will be stored, which was shown in Tab. \ref{ywu:table:strip}. All 
parameter classed are compatible with the FairRoot framework scheme and could be used 
for the data analysis \cite{ywu:fr}.

\subsection{Application}
An implementation of the STS QA database and its web interface based on FairDB is
 available now. It stores information on sensor parameters and quality assurance results
 as well ass tracking information for logistic purpose.\\

The FairDB will be used to store a large number of sensor parameters. These information
 is used to make decision on defect severity in order to accept or reject a sensor under
 test for future use in STS detector. In order to extract the information on the strip
 properties, strip diagnostic tests will be performed. All of the parameters could be
 measured using probe station and devices in cleanroom (see Sect. \ref{ywu:sec:setup}).
 For example, we can check the parameters with acceptance criteria which determines the
 strip would be connected or not. Fig. \ref{ywu:fig:pinhole} shows the pinhole test data
 of all the strip in a sensor's one side. It provides visual result and makes it more
 intuitively to find defective strip.\\
 
A central database is also important for tracking the shipment of sensors and other components
 between institutions during their lifetime. The FairDB data scheme contains, among others,
 the tables and structures for these logistic purpose.
